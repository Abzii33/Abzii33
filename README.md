- 👋 Hi, I’m @Abzii33 and I so far learned basic Python,
Also took part of a Cloud Bootcamp: in which I covered many topics in a short time.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Cloud and DevOps.
- 🌱 Being said that, I’m currently learning in a pace to fit in with my schedule
And I am going over each of the topics covered specifically Python alone, for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my understanding and use of GitHub etc
